# Troubleshooting

There are several resources available if you need help:
* First try asking on the Hall lab Slack channel. The #systems page is very useful for cluster-related issues.
* You can join the mgibio Slack channel. Sometimes updates related to cluster performance will be posted here. Ask a lab member for an invitation to this channel.
* You can find some background information on Confluence (https://confluence.ris.wustl.edu/). You will need to log in with your MGI credentials.
* For an issue that you or a lab member cannot solve, you can submit a ticket here after logging in with your MGI credentials: https://jira.ris.wustl.edu/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/create/43
